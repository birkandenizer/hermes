# Hermes

Many of the available communication means today require users to be identified. However they neither provide a temporary connection between users nor keep personal information private. This project aims to help users communicate without exposing their personal contact information. Additionaly these communication channels will be temporary. By the help of this service users can protect their identities. They can also arrange certain time scales to get contacted.
